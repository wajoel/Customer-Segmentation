This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Load and preprocess data
data <- simulate_customer_data()
data <- encode_categorical(data, c("Gender", "CreditCardUsage", "LoanHistory"))
data <- normalize_data(data, c("Age", "Income", "MonthlySpend", "SavingsBalance", "TransactionsPerMonth", "Tenure"))

# Determine optimal clusters
elbow_method(data)

# Perform clustering
kmeans_result <- perform_kmeans(data, k = 4)

# Summarize clusters
summary <- summarize_clusters(data, kmeans_result$cluster)
print(summary)

# Visualize clusters
visualize_clusters(data, kmeans_result$cluster)

# Save results
save_processed_data(data
                    # "segmented_customers.csv"
                    )

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
